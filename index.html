    <h1 class="sub-title">OUR BELIEF</h1>

         <p>    People talk about physical fitness, but mental health is equally not so important.We see
                people sufering, and their families fuel a sense of shame about it, which doesn't help.<p>
            <p> One needs support and understanding.And that's why we are here to listen to your thougt as
                you share what's bothering your mind with us.We know depresson begins with disappointment,
                when disappointment fosters in our soul, it leads to discouragement</p>

            <p> Being sad and being depressed are two differnt things. Also, peolpe going through depressing situations
                don't look so,while someone sad will look sad.The most common reaction is "How can you be depressed?"
                you have everything going for you.You are the supposed number one heroine, that's what almost everyone
                thinks.</p>

            <p> People who have never dealth with depresson think its just being sad or being in a bad mood.
                That's not what depression is,its falling into a state of greyness and numbness.</p>

            <p> There isn't anybody out there who doesn't have a mental health issue,whether it is depression, anxiety, or how to cope with relationships. Having obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
                is not an embarrasement anymore.Just know that there is help and your life could be better if you seek for our help. And the goodnews is
                that, we are here for you to share your worries.</p>
